# Python-Life Expectancy Project

# Life Expectancy Data Analysis

## Overview

This project explores global life expectancy trends using data from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/topic-details/GHO/life-expectancy). Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, it aims to uncover patterns and insights related to life expectancy across different countries and regions over time.

**Project Motivation**

Understanding life expectancy is crucial for assessing the overall health and well-being of populations. This project seeks to analyze historical data to identify factors influencing life expectancy and to observe how it has evolved over the years.

**Data Sources**

The analysis utilizes the following datasets:

-**Life Expectancy Data**: Sourced from Kaggle's [Life Expectancy (WHO) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who), which compiles life expectancy figures along with various health indicators for multiple countries over several years.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Additional Socioeconomic Indicators**: Gathered from the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), offering context on factors such as GDP, education, and healthcare access.

**Installation and Setup**

To replicate this analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   
   git clone https://github.com/chinmacreates/life-expectancy-analysis.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**


cd life-expectancy-analysis

3. **Install Required Packages:**

pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The requirements.txt includes:

-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-jupyter

**Usage**
To explore the analysis:

Launch Google Colab:


Open the Notebook:

In the Colab interface, open life_expectancy_analysis.ipynb.

Run the Cells:

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

**Results**
The analysis reveals:

Global Trends: An overall increase in life expectancy over the past decades.

Regional Disparities: Notable differences between regions, with some areas experiencing slower improvements.

Correlations: Positive associations between life expectancy and indicators like GDP per capita and education levels.
